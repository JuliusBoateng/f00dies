		<p>Description: The project has two searches, a recipe search and a restaurant search. For the restaurant searches, <br/>
      the user enters general food dishes such as coffee, hamburgers, chicken, etc. The search matches the <br/>
      item to menu items listed on campus restaurant menus. The restaurant along with its location, name, <br/>
      and hours are returned as well as the menu item with its price, calories, allergy, and “student rating”. <br/>
      The “student rating” will be calculated through an algorithm that the group will develop through user user <br/>
      data in the form of a survey. The recipe search will be processed by creating an entry that matches the general <br/>
      dish being searched with a  link to the recipe.<br/>
    </p>

    <p> Usefulness: The project will be useful because the campus dining app does not detail which location sells which product, <br/>
      but only gives a general overview of the restaurant. Similar apps such as Yelp only provides restaurants known for selling <br/>
      foods that match the specific type of food searched but does not do a good job displaying nondescript restaurants that sell <br/>
      the food being searched. Another similar app is supercook, which is an application that lets the user input ingredients to <br/>
      search for recipes. Our project is different because the user can get information on physical restaurants that sells the food <br/>
      item they want as well as provide recipes. <br/>
      </p>

      <p> Realness: The data for our project will come primarily from Notre Dame Dining. Notre Dame probably has a database that lists all <br/>
        of the different foods that they sell along with their restaurants. The recipe information can be provided through a recipe websites. <br/>
      </p>

      <p> Functionality: Basic function: Insert menu items and restaurants into database with data from ND dining. Output the appropriate restaurant <br/>
        add menu items if the user food search matches the general category of a menu item. For the recipe search, insert recipe links into database. <br/>
        Output link if the user’s general food search category matches a recipe category. <br/>
      </p>
        <p>
        Advanced function: 1.) Getting recipes for dishes based on user constraints such as calories and allergens. <br/>
        2.) Constantly getting user data by attaching a survey to our site and using that information to rate the menu items <br/>
        and categorize the search results. <br/>
