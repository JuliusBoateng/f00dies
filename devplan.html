        <h2>Software Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Angular, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Python, MySQL <br> <br>

                HTML/CSS/Javascript/Angular will be used on the front-end, while one/some of the other listed language(s) will be used for the back-end/middle-ware logic (e.g. advanced functions).    
                Of course, we will be using MySQL for our database.

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>
                The restaurant data will come from either the http://nutrition.nd.edu/1 website or from a spreadsheet or raw file from dining@nd.edu. 
                Spoonacular API will be used to fill the recipe database. The data for our restaurant results ordering algorithm will come from ND students from our various classes. 
            </p>

            <h2>Division of Labour</h2>
            <p>
                Brendan will focus on the front-end/user interface. Luke will spearhead the database-related tools, which includes on-paper abstractions (e.g. relational schema, entity sets, etc) as well as the SQL implementation. 
                Blaise and Julius will implement the middle-ware and backend logic for the website, which includes finding and utilizing an appropriate API for recipes, implementing the rating system, and other advanced functionalities. 
                Of course, these boundaries arenâ€™t static, and will certainly change as the project comes together.
